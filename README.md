# WinForms-Recoil-Macro
An old recoil macro created at least 3 years ago

## Requirements
Bunifu framework

## Desc
The purpose of this project was to help compensate for the recoil in rainbow six siege, and to get somewhat familiar with win forms. I also wanted to look into the bunifu framework since it looked cool (this is removed from the project since I don't own a license, but v1.5.3 is on google of course).

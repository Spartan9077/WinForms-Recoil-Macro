# WinForms-Recoil-Macro
An old recoil macro created at least 3 years ago

### Requirements
Bunifu framework (I used v1.5.3)

### Desc
This is just my version of the extremely common "recoil macros" that are ubiquitous on the internet. The purpose of this project was to help compensate for the recoil in rainbow six siege, and to get somewhat familiar with win forms. I also wanted to look into the bunifu framework since it looked cool (this is removed from the project since I don't own a license, but v1.5.3 is on google of course). The actual names of the files and directories are completely unrelated to the purpose of the project in case battleye checks for stuff like that. I believe I used this for 6 months or so and never had any issues.

### How to build
Once you have the bunifu dll (you should just be able to throw in the /bin/debug or /bin/release directory) everything should be all set to build the project

### Usage
You can select the "speed" or how quickly the mouse moves down the screen. You can increase or decrease the speed by pressing Numpad + or -.
Sleep is how long the macro waits in between each execution (slower may be better for slower fire rate weapons). 
The keybind dropdown menu specifies which keypress will start the recoil compensation(usually just left click). 
The "Wait for right click" checkbox will not run the recoil compensation unless both the keybind specified and the right click button are pressed.
Finally, you can just click on the "Run" checkbox to run. You can also press the "End" key on your keyboard to toggle it on and off
